Twitter-Sentiment-Classifier-
=============================
 For this project I extracted twitter data from their API to classify tweets as postive, negative, or neutral. 
<br>I used a subset of a training dataset. This dataset included 3000 tweets that were hand classified as either positive, negative, or neutral. 
I used google chart to display the result in a graphical form. Demo photo's below:
